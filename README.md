# Customer Default Risk Prediction

##  Project Overview
This project predicts the probability of customer loan default using machine learning and deep learning models.

##  Files in this repo
- `customer default risk prediction.ipynb` → Jupyter notebook with full workflow.
- `synthetic_dataset_10000x20.csv` → Dataset used.
- `student_task_instructions.txt` → Instructions for the project.
- `Customer Default Risk Prediction report.pdf` → Detailed report with results.

##  Steps Followed
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – distributions, correlations, outliers.
2. **Data Preprocessing** – missing values, encoding, scaling, feature engineering.
3. **Model Training** – Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning** – GridSearchCV for optimal parameters.
5. **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** – implemented using TensorFlow/Keras.
6. **Evaluation** – Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, Confusion Matrix.

##  Results
- Logistic Regression: ~93%  
- Decision Tree: ~94%  
- SVM: ~94%  
- Random Forest: ~94%  
- XGBoost: ~96%  
- ANN: ~95.4%
