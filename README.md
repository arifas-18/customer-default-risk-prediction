## ⚙️ Steps Followed
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – distributions, correlations, outliers.
2. **Data Preprocessing** – missing values, encoding, scaling, feature engineering.
3. **Model Training** – Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning** – GridSearchCV for optimal parameters.
5. **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** – implemented using TensorFlow/Keras.
6. **Evaluation** – Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, Confusion Matrix.
